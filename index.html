    <p> <h3>C6 Control</h3>
    <p> <strong> When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</strong><br />
      The main causes of triggers can be poor direction, or an inability to understand what is expected to be delivered. In essence managing expectation and being able to envisage how to deliver the result. Disproportionate emotional frustration comes from hitting walls when coding, examples of which comes from getting to the point in software development where by you get frustrated with the result you are attempting to acheive is illusive.

    <p> <h3>T5 Problem Solving</h3>
    <p> <strong> What was the problem? </strong><br />
      The problem was to use the code that we had learnt to create a game to edit 9 different areas in a box and show then filled on a screen in real time. Then tell an end user number of areas that had been filled. Also the boxes that were being filled were of different colors some with no colors. This all had to be counted and shown to the user.

        <h3>C5 Self Confidence</h3>
        <p> <strong> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness? </strong><br />
          It is written within the book Search Inside Yourself, from a certain point of view the self awareness and mindfulness is the same thing. The author describes that mindfulness is the ability to stay focused in a particular perspective while a number of thoughts may be attempting to distract you. The example used in the book looks at a flagpole and a flag fluttering in the wind. The wind can be the emotions or thoughts that surround and move the flag. The flag is you and the flagpole is the ability to stay in a mindful or self aware perspective.

        <p> <strong>  What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong><br />
          From my perspective, I found it relatively easy to gain and keep rapport for using this process. Gaining agreement and assuring the person become more natural in the flow of conversation and bring about positive and constructive tones when communicating.

    <h3>T4 JavaScript Basic's</h3>
    <p> <strong> How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong><br />
      The JavaScript language allow websites and pages to carry out logical processes, that can complement HTML and CSS for end users. The language allows actions to be preformed, for example calculations, storage of information, repetitive actions, and other functions that would not be able to be preformed, on the web page. In comparison to HTML and CSS, JavaScript allows for more specific interactions with the end user.

          I am not sure that I followed the process over product method in the correct manner. I appear to get stuck early on in seeming easy error that dragged out my timeline for delivery. At a suitable time it would be good value to discuss this with you.

          <h3>Technical Blog Part 2 </h3>

          <p> <strong> What is grid based design?</strong><br /> </p>
          <p> This is a method of leveraging the capacity of CSS and HTML to display content relative to a webpage. For example say you have 3 stories of content that you wish to display on page vertically in parallel on a webpage. The most suitable method that can be used would be grid approach using CSS Row's and Column's. This would allow content to be displayed in such a way. It is also important to note you can also use HTML tables, however this would not be easily responsive.
