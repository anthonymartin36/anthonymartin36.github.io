          <h4>T3 Design to Web</h4>
          <p> <strong> What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</strong><br />
          A responsive site is when a website is viewable from multiple devices say for example a mobile device or a large computer screen. Responsiveness is important because, the we is now being viewed by multiple devices from a broad audience. To make information and services available today on the web, sites must be responsive.
          </p>
          <p> <strong> What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</strong><br />
          The best description I have read, "The mobile-first approach is exactly as it sounds: designing for the smallest screen and working your way up. It is one of the best strategies to create either a responsive or adaptive design". It is important to know because how we interact with the small screen is as important as how we access information on other devices. Interaction with smaller screens has its restrictions in terms of styles, images and interactions, keeping simplicity at the core of the experience can help.
          </p>
          <p> <strong> What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</strong><br />
          The main framework that was used fro this work was the <a href="http://getskeleton.com/"> Skeleton </a>. There are a number of different frameworks, the main one that has been worked with here is Skeleton.
          <table>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td> Pros</td>
              <td> Cons</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td> The framework was easy to plugin and use.</td>
              <td> The framework needed considerable time to come up to speed with how to use it.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td> A lot of the simple fundementals are already in place for you to start.</td>
              <td> As an newbie, there were some complications about understanding how to implement some more specifics.</td>
            </tr>
            <tbody>
          </table>
          <p> <strong> What a wireframe is and why we use it.</strong><br />
          A wireframe is effectively a template from which to start developing a web page from. The process is to create an underlying well formatted page structure to support the page content and site navagation that is to be displayed.

          <p><strong> The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.</strong><br />
              There were a number of minor issues for example using the @media structure that took a number of hour to debug. and get on with other work asscoicated with the weeks project. This was a serious setback, debugging this was very frustrating.
