    <h1>Reflections on the Shereef's Fireside Chat</h1>
    <h3>04 May 2017</h3>

    <p><strong> What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience? </strong> </ br>
    Shereef is certainly a passionate salesman. It is quite a daunting experience with new environment, people, learning and failing. I can see alot of struggling ahead.  </p>
    <p><strong> What are your impressions? </strong> </ br>
    My impression from the conversation is that it will be quite an exciting experience, and I will need a lot of energy inthe tank to meet the expectations to deliver results but also be able to interact appropiately with others in teams.</p>
    <p><strong> How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? </strong> </ br>
      Really for me culture is very important. I have worked in a number of different Orgainsations with good and bad culture. A bad is very draining, and bitchy. A team with the right motives and goals but also comradery is awesome.</p>
    <p><strong> Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how? </strong> </ br>
      Not as much as I have initially thought, it will be an up hill struggle, I  certainly respect the expectation of delivery more.</p>
    <p><strong> Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? </strong> </ br>
    Yes and Yes. I will put my best foot forwards</p>
