        <h4>T5 Problem Solving</h4>
        <p> <strong> What was the problem? </strong><br />
          The problem was to use the code that we had learnt to create a game to edit 9 different areas in a box and show then filled on a screen in real time. Then tell an end user number of areas that had been filled. Also the boxes that were being filled were of different colors some with no colors. This all had to be counted and shown to the user.
        </p>
        <p> <strong> What problem solving techniques did you use? </strong><br />
          There were a number of different challenges that had to be overcome, for example we had to pull in  information from the web page and sorting out said different information. Somtimes I would draw out the different interactions to establish what the concept was. Rereading the issue to understand what exactly was required to forfill the challenge. Look at the information that was being exchanged between elements of the code and so forth. I was fortunate using these techniques that the problem could be solved.
        </p>
        <p> <strong> How did you feel throughout the process?</strong><br />
          This was a challenging week, the reading in and extracting the information using JavaScript was difficult to understand. There was a lot of print out of what had been done to understand what infact I was doing. In a way I was lucky to get as far as I did with the work.
        </p>
        <p> <strong>  What did you learn? </strong><br />
          Proabably just to relax and enjoy the work. Time is always a factor, however I have come very far in the process and have learnt a lot. I think that I was quite prepared for the week of work which was a real advantage.
        </p>

        <p> <ul> <strong> Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process: </strong><br />

          <li><i>Pseudocode :</i>  Writing out what needs to be done to logically acheive the result.</li></ br>
          <li><i>Trying something :</i>  Running some code to show what can is being done with different methods and statements. This is a good way to see what can be produced.</li></ br>
          <li><i><i>Rubber ducky method :</i> Not sure.    </li></ br>
          <li><i>Reading error messages :</i> Error messages are not always fun. However they do show in the code that has been created where they unreadable by the browser or compiler. Specifically the line of unreadable code, so as it can be amended.</li></ br>
          <li><i>Console.logging :</i> Logging to the developer screen was good value. Especially when attempting to determine the value of a variable (or var) as it is being used in the code. </li></ br>
          <li><i>Googling :</i> A lifesaver, especially when attempting to remembering how a piece of code is to be used or the context of how it is used.   </li></ br>
          <li><i>Asking your peers for help :</i> A second pair of eyes on what is being asked or, what exactly you are attempting to do. I had help thankfully with this program.  </li></ br>
          <li><i>Asking coaches for help :</i> Always good to get some reference form the boss.  </li></ br>
          <li><i>Improving your process with reflection :</i> I find it can be frustrating attempting to solve a problem, spending significant amounts of time on a solution, only to find when you come back froma break and you are able to solve the problem.     </li></ br>
        </ul></p>

        <p><ul>
          <strong> Describe what these functions do in your own words: </strong> </ br>
          <li><i>.map(); </i>  Say you have a list of numbers saved in some code, and you want to carry out some processes with this code. Using the Map function you can collectively carry out functions on these numbers without effecting the origional numbers.   </li></ br>
          <li><i>.filter(); </i> Again if you have a list of numbers and you wish to carry out some processes, say find which numbers are above or below a certain value. You can use this function to establish which numbers in a list are above or below said value.    </li></ br>
          <li><i>.reduce(); </i>  This function allows a list of numbers to be reduced to a specific number. This function will not execute if some of the values are not numbers. Again used in a list of numbers.   </li></ br>
        </ul></p>
