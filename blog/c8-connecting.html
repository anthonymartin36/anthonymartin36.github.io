         <p> <strong>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go? </strong><br />
           The Book outlines in this chapter that Trust is very important. Weather it be in a team  or one on one coaching/mentoring. Core to this is building rapport and listening, also the other aspect of this is how an individual would determine their own involvement given the level of trust in the relationship. The latter point about sincerity can some down to two things, according to Dr. Karen May: 1)Practivly giveing people the benifit of the Doubt, and 2) Remember trust begets Trust. Aristotle said, “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.”

         <p> <strong> Try empathic listening - how did it go? </strong><br />
           Before reading this chapter, I attempted empathic listening. I did this with sales appointments I had. Effectively I had to give my undivided attention in those meetings as any relative infomation is gold. I would do this by sitting up straight and breathing through my nose straight into my stomach. This lowered my heart rate and allowed me to take in all the relative infomration. It also had the effect of removing any perspective that would have clouded my judgement. I found this to be a very good tool.

         <p> <strong> How did you find the loving kindness meditation? </strong><br />
           I reflected on a Family member that I had not though of for some time. It allowed me to see the world from their perspective, which I can't recall the last time I gave it some thought. It was good.

         <p> <strong> Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</strong><br />
           <i>My perspective</i><br />
           Sometime ago I was let go from a company. The reason was not for poor performance, aparently it was just financial. I was very angry and disapointed at this as I had worked very hard for the company, this involved a lot of stress and required skill to get them to agree to deals. In the end I was happy and even stated that I was glad to be leaving, which I was. On reflection I was embittered by their intransigence not to take up opportunities that would have enriched them.
           <i>Their perspective</i><br />
           Anthony was a good worker, however the business demanded that we make some cost changes and he had to go, as he was on contract this was easily done. There was a disconnect between what was required from Anthony and what he did for us. We wanted to know what was going on in the market, where as Anthony went a step further and attempted to bring in deals. I have now doubt in Anthony's capabilities he will be  a very successful Account Manager, In this instance this is not what we require.
