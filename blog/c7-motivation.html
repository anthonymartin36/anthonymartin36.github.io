        <h4>C7 Motivation</h4>
        <p> <strong>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens? </strong><br />
          These are things that I have seen in the work place. Most notibly the purpose point that the writer makes about Mark, founder of Zappos. In my previous Sales career with negoations of large deals, defining the mission and purpose of the offering drove more succes out of those deal, i.e. the client saw clearly the value. I would say from experience I had more control over a deal with peoperly outlined purpose, than just being in the deal. As for pleasure, from how I am internalising it hes is describing what are the key finate determinates of success, and building them into every day actions. So at the end of a days work one can look back at what they have acheived. Finally Passion, or as it is quoted "Flow", or to paraphrase rhythm in work or striving to acheive a goal, this flow to me is a measure of one's ability to manage their agreement to acheive their goal. In effect the writer is asking you to look at what you do, how to structure you activities to feel better about yourself, productively.
        </p>
        <p> <strong>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, </strong><br />
          <ul>
            <li><i>What are your core values? </i> The only lens I will answer this question is through a job, I value being happy in my/a Job. It mainly boils down to what is the goal that is being strived for, or attempted. The people I work with and how I get on with them, in work and personal time. How I feel that I am able to complete the task that are asigned to me and my ability to get on with my manager.</li>
            <li><i>What do you stand for? </i> Myself, right now in my life I must look after myself. I do care about those that are around me, and I am concerned for their well being. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p> <strong>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</strong><br />
          Reflecting on failure as well as success was an interesting perspective. Especially when failure can take a lot of emotional and physical energy, in comparison to success. My personal belief has been that you must rid or manage those emotions associated with the event and move on, provided you take the learning. 
        </p>
        <p> <strong>Any other musings?</strong><br />
          Not at this time.
