          <h4>T4 JavaScript Basic's</h4>
          <p> <strong> How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong><br />
            The JavaScript language allow websites and pages to carry out logical processes, that can complement HTML and CSS for end users. The language allows actions to be preformed, for example calculations, storage of information, repetitive actions, and other functions that would not be able to be preformed, on the web page. In comparison to HTML and CSS, JavaScript allows for more specific interactions with the end user.
          </p>
          <p> <strong> Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</strong><br />
            We can use Control flow and Loops to carry out actions in specific ways. For example, lets look at the process of brushing teeth. Provided we have a toothbrush, toothpaste and water to complete this action. Then we must understand the point at which our teeth are clean. While we are cleaning our teeth, we must repeat the process of brushing until we feel that they are clean. At which point we stop and wash our mouth out with water. The brushing process is comparable to looping. Where the rules are repeating until the constant is set, in this instance the weather the teeth are clean or not, if not repeat.
          </p>
          <p> <strong>  Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</strong><br />
            Information must be referenced from Array's and Object's in different ways. For example with Array's the information is logged sequentially from 0 to the nth required element. Extracting said information, could be done by referencing a specific location within an array or other means. Objects on the other hand contain multiple properties, which are not sequential but related to the object itself i.e. a coin make can be, silver or copper, a coin side can be either; heads or tails. An object property can be referenced by its "Name", rather than an Array, which can be referenced by location by sequence.
          </p>
          <p> <strong> Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</strong><br />
            Functions are methods that can be called upon in specific instances. Functions allow for information to be provided, actions to be taken and information to be returned. Functions allow for logic of a program to be broken up into simple components that allow for execution if and when required.
