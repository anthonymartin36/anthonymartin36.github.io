          <H3>What is grid based design?</H3>
          <p> This is a method of leveraging the capacity of CSS and HTML to display content relative to a webpage. For example say you have 3 stories of content that you wish to display on page vertically in parallel on a webpage. The most suitable method that can be used would be grid approach using CSS Row's and Column's. This would allow content to be displayed in such a way. It is also important to note you can also use HTML tables, however this would not be easily responsive.  </p>

          <H3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</H3>
          <p> Websites are now being viewed through a number of different device, be it Wide Screen TV's, Computers, tablets and smart phone. To be able to view the content, the infomration must be made available through responsive design. Meaning web pages must have their content structured in such a way to be easily understandable to said devices. So a web page can be read by a iphone and computer alike.  </p>

          <h3> What is semantic structure? </h3>
          <p> Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Semantic HTML is processed by traditional web browsers as well as by many other user agents. </p>

          <H3> Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on. </H3>
          <p> Frankly, I thought the grid based design was the most interesting part of this Sprint so far. The way in whic content can be structure on a web page. Although I have created content online previously and attempted to pull apart websites to see how these structures have been made.I was never quite sure how these were created. </p>
