    <p><strong> which timebox and habits techniques did you try? </strong> </ br>
    I did attemp to use the toggl technique to track my time keeping, but I have not attempted to time box to explore the code. Setting up an environment to play can be challenging. </p>
    <p><strong> what did you find interesting? </strong> </ br>
      I really enjoyed playing with the Github tools, I did get quite frustrated with Github cmd line and had to Safari on Stack overflow once or twice.</p>
    <p><strong> what worked for you? </strong> </ br>
      I don't know some how I have gotten this far, reviously when working with code and setting up web servers/Databases it could get very frustrating. </p>
    <p><strong> which will you experiment further with? </strong> </ br>
    Workflow will be an area that I will need to put in some more investment, certainly</p>
