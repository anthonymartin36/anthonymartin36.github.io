          <h4>C5 Self Confidence</h4>
          <p> <strong> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness? </strong><br />
            It is written within the book Search Inside Yourself, from a certain point of view the self awareness and mindfulness is the same thing. The author describes that mindfulness is the ability to stay focused in a particular perspective while a number of thoughts may be attempting to distract you. The example used in the book looks at a flagpole and a flag fluttering in the wind. The wind can be the emotions or thoughts that surround and move the flag. The flag is you and the flagpole is the ability to stay in a mindful or self aware perspective.
          </p>
          <p> <strong> Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel? </strong><br />
            I did the body scan for 15 minutes. This was a good exercise, it taught me where my body is at with stress and the workload at the moment and where I store these emotions within my body. It appears doing this course and full time work it can be quite exhausting.
          </p>
          <p> <strong> What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section? </strong><br />
            The example towards the end of the chapter of, thoughts and emotions are like the clouds and they come in many different forms. In relation to us we are like the Sky and the clouds are like thoughts and emotions. The variation in the clouds are not who we are. Interesting.
