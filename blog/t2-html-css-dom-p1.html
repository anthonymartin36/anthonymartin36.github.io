          <H3>HTML</H3>
          <p> HTML or Hypertext Markup Language is the language used for web browsers to establish the structure of Web pages. In essence HTML allows a page to be broken down into its most basic components and be able to be read by a web browser.

          <h3> What is meant by boxifying design? </h3>
          <p> My understanding of Boxifying design is when Design/User Experience Consultant or Graphics Designer hands over a design of a proposed website or page thereof. At this point the Developer will break down the page into its basic components through layering boxes over the design to isolate the challenges of the design of the page. From here the Developer has a plan of attack in developing the page. </p>

        <div class="col-6 end">
          <H3> What is the box model? </H3>
          <p> All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. </p>
